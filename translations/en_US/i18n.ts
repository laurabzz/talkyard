// Note:
// - If the first char in the field name is Uppercase, then the
//   textual value also starts with an Uppercase letter.
//   E.g. `Close: "Close"`, and `close: "close"`.
// - The text value of a field that ends with ...Q, ends with ?. E.g. `DeleteQ: "Delete?"`.
// - The text value of a field that ends with ...C, ends with :. E.g. `PasswordC: "Password:"`.
// - If the field ends with an N, then it's a noun (not a verb). Example:
//   In English, the word "chat" is both a noun and a verb, but in other languages,
//   two different words might be needed â€” and then there're two fields for the translators
//   `ChatN: "(noun here)"` and `ChatV: "(verb here)"`.
// - If the field ends with an V, then it's a verb (not a noun)
